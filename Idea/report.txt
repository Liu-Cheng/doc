1. Blocking and loop unrolling. There is no direct data dependency between blocking and communication cost.
Buffer size can be dicided easily based on IO of the loop.

2. IO bandwidth is not an interesting design parameter, as having larger IO bandwidth doesn't have clear design penalty.
Not an interesting trade-off.

3. The performance model will be the focus of the customization framework and we can't simplify it with a simple opc parameter.
It determines the loop unrolling factor, CGRA size and interleaving.

4. The performance I get from current scheduler is not enough for modeling. As the performance gets bad when CGRA size goes up for smaller DFGs which are less than 1 thousand.

5. Evolving scheduling algorithm for IO intensive DFG scheduling.
Load part of the input data, start the computation.

1. The design space is not as big as expected.
2. The impact of the design parameters on performance is usually monotonic. 
   Loop unrolling --> better performance and larger overhead
   CGRA size --> better performance and larger overhead
   IO Buffer size --> better performance and larger overhead
   IO Buffer bandwidth --> better performance and no clear penalty

   Design goal? performance/cost
