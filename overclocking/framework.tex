\section{CNN accelerator overclocking} \label{sec:framework}
In contrast to the typical offline training framework on GPPs, we propose an 
on-accelerator training framework to allow the CNN accelerator's runtime variation 
caused by approximate arithmetic logic, overclocking or soft errors 
to be learned with the application data. With the on-accelerator training,
the obtained model can be deployed despite the accelerator's 
undeterministic behavior. Details of the framework will be presented in 
the rest of this section.
