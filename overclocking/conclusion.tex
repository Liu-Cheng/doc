\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:Conclusion}
Neural networks executed on FPGA based CNN accelerators 
are typically bounded by the computing. While overclocking 
that boosts the clock frequency 
directly affects the accelerator operation speed and performance, 
it also leads to some unpredictable timing violations. By taking 
advantage of the inherent neural network fault-tolerance 
and FPGA reconfiguration capability, we propose a series of 
error detection and recovery scheme to alleviate the accuracy 
loss. According to the experiments on 
a set of neural network benchmark, we can obtain both the 
performance and energy efficiency significantly with negligible 
accuracy loss.
