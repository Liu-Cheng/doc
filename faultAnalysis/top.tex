\begin{abstract}
    Deep neural network (DNN) is making continuous breakthroughs 
    in massive domains of applications and is increasingly 
    deployed on customized DNN accelerators for both the 
    higher performance and energy efficiency. While the 
    increasing hardware failures caused by the shrinking semiconductor 
    technology may have substantial influence on the accelerators and 
    improving the resilience of the neural network execution becomes a great 
    challenge especially to mission-critical applications such as self-driving 
    and medical diagnose. The reliability analysis of the neural 
    network execution is a key step to understand and alleviate the influence 
    of the hardware failures, and thus is highly demanded. 
    
    Prior works typically focus on the computing errors of neural networks caused by 
    hardware faults with simulation, but there is still a lack of fault 
    analysis from a system point of view. For instance, the consequences of 
    the system such as system stall are also critical to resilient 
    neural network execution. In this work, we implemented a 
    representative neural network accelerator as well as fault injection modules 
    on a Xilinx ARM-FPGA platform (ZC706). Then we conducted comprehensive fault 
    analysis of the system using four typical neural network models
    from different system angles including system functionality, 
    fault coverage, and input variation as well as prediction 
    accuracy loss. Based on the analysis, we find that system stall 
    caused by hardware faults is non-trivial to the system reliability 
    and further propose an efficient approach to alleviate it with negligible 
    hardware overhead.
