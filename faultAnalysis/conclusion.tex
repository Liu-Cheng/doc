\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

With the wide application of neural network in many 
scenarios with high safety requirements like autonomous 
driving, the fault-tolerant performance of neural network 
accelerators has received more attention. In this paper, we 
designed a fault emulation and analysis system for neural 
network accelerator based on SRAM-based FPGA, and completed 
a series of experiments on this basis. We find that the 
fault tolerance of neural network accelerator is poor, and 
analyze the misrepresentation of different numbers, 
different network applications and different error 
locations. These analyses provide a reference for the 
following fault-tolerant design.
