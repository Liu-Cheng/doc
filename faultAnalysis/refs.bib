abstract = {Abstract—Sensitivity of electronic circuits to radiation effects is an increasing concern in modern designs. As technology scales down, Single Event Upsets (SEUs) are made more frequent and probable, affecting not only space applications, but also applica- tions at earth's surface, like automotive applications. Fault injec- tion is a method widely used to evaluate the SEU sensitivity of dig- ital circuits. Among the existing fault injection techniques, those based onFPGAemulation have proven tobe the fastest ones. In this paper a unified emulation environment which combines two fault injection techniques based on FPGA emulation is proposed. The new emulation environment provides both, a high speed tool for quick fault detection, and a medium speed tool for in-depth anal- ysis of SEUs propagation. The experiments presented here show that the two techniques can be successfully applied in a comple- mentary manner.},

abstract = {As the high performance computing (HPC) community continues to push towards exascale computing, resilience remains a serious challenge. With the expected decrease of both feature size and operating voltage, we expect a significant increase in hardware soft errors. HPC applications of today are only affected by soft errors to a small degree but we expect that this will become a more serious issue as HPC systems grow. We propose F-SEFI, a Fine-grained Soft Error Fault Injector, as a tool for profiling software robustness against soft errors. In this paper we utilize soft error injection to mimic the impact of errors on logic circuit behavior. Leveraging the open source virtual machine hypervisor QEMU, F-SEFI enables users to modify emulated machine instructions to introduce soft errors. F-SEFI can control what application, which sub-function, when and how to inject soft errors with different granularities, without interference to other applications that share the same environment. F-SEFI does this without requiring revisions to the application source code, compilers or operating systems. We discuss the design constraints for F-SEFI and the specifics of our implementation. We demonstrate use cases of F-SEFI on several benchmark applications to show how data corruption can propagate to incorrect results.},

abstract = {The revival of neural networks has significantly accentuated the development and proliferation of Machine Learning (ML) systems. This trend is intensifying with major focus on embedded systems with sometimes strong architectural constraints. As often happens with such technological disruptions, the main efforts are massively focused on performance relegating security in the background. Yet, since neu-ral networks-based systems will be ubiquitous, it is essential to wonder whether such systems are not intrinsically sensitive to threats targeting their integrity, confidentiality or accessibility. Thanks to previous works, we know that an attacker can fool a supervised classifier or even extract confidential data or IP leaking from a model. In this paper, we propose an overview of attacks that threaten ML algorithms and particularly neural networks with a focus on adversarial examples which have strong properties like transferability. Physical attacks (side-channel analysis, fault injection) will also be presented as upcoming attack vectors against embedded ML. Then, we discuss some state-of-the-art protection schemes as well as the importance of methods and tools to evaluate the robust-ness of models that could help the dissemination of good practice for the design and development of durable and secure ML systems.},

However, due to its high sensitivity to neutron-induced soft errors, the FPGA configuration memory bits may suffer unexpected bit-flips and consequently critical errors may occur. To cope with this problem, authors have proposed several mitigation techniques, which must be verified under the presence of faults. Since ground-level radiation experiments are very costly, fault injection is a suitable method to verify mitigation techniques in early stages of development. In this work, we present a fault injector platform implemented in a FPGA commercial board able to inject multiple bit-flips in the configuration memory bits of SRAM-based FPGAs based on a fault database collected on radiation experiments. We show the accuracy of our proposed fault injection campaign compared to radiation test results. We compare the soft error rate of three designs under the accumulation of multiple faults.},

abstract = {By technology down scaling in nowadays digital circuits, their sensitivity to radiation effects increases, making the occurrence of soft errors more probable. As a consequence, soft error rate estimation of complex circuits such as processors is becoming an important issue in safety- and mission-critical applications. Fault injection is a well-known and widely used approach for soft error rate estimation. Development of previous FPGA-based fault injection techniques is very time consuming mainly because they do not adequately exploit supplementary FPGA tools. This paper proposes an easy-to-develop and flexible FPGA-based fault injection technique. This technique utilizes debugging facilities of Altera FPGAs in order to inject single event upset (SEU) and multiple bit upset (MBU) fault models in both flip-flops and memory units. As this technique uses FPGA built-in facilities, it imposes negligible performance and area overheads on the system. The experimental results show that the proposed technique is on average four orders of magnitude faster than a pure simulation-based fault injection. These features make the proposed technique applicable to industrial-scale circuits. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Fully autonomous vehicles (AVs), i.e., AVs with autonomy level 5, are expected to dominate road transportation in the near-future and contribute trillions of dollars to the global economy. The general public, government organizations, and manufacturers all have significant concern regarding resiliency and safety standards of the autonomous driving system (ADS) of AVs. In this work, we proposed and developed (a) 'Kayotee'-a fault injection-based tool to systematically inject faults into software and hardware components of the ADS to assess the safety and reliability of AVs to faults and errors, and (b) an ontology model to characterize errors and safety violations impacting reliability and safety of AVs. Kayotee is capable of characterizing fault propagation and resiliency at different levels-(a) hardware, (b) software, (c) vehicle dynamics, and (d) traffic resilience. We used Kayotee to study a proprietary ADS technology built by Nvidia corporation and are currently applying Kayotee to other open-source ADS systems. I. INTRODUCTION The safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs) are significant concerns among all the stakeholders. Our previous work [1] characterized a California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) dataset on reported AV road testing and showed that as many as 36{\%} of disengagements were caused by computer system problems and 64{\%} were due to machine learning problems. AV research has traditionally focused on improving machine learning and artificial intelligence models. However, as these models are deployed at large scale on computing platforms, the focus is to assess the resilience and safety features of the compute stack driving the AVs. The effects of faults and errors in the hardware (GPUs, CPUs and other processing units) running the AV software stack is not well understood. Recent work [2]-[5] exclusively focus on the resiliency of deep neural networks (DNNs) to hardware faults and errors without accounting for the inherent resiliency in the software stack. [6], [7] study the safety of AVs by injecting sensor-related permanent faults such as Gaussian noise, occlusion, etc. into publicly available autonomous driving system (such as CARLA [8] and Open Pilot [9]). However, these autonomous driving system (ADS) are overly simplistic with few sensors and are not representative of a production ADS. Moreover, such studies have limited scope as they cannot characterize error masking and propagation of transient, and permanent faults in the ADS. We believe our work is the first to study the impact of transient errors, intermittent errors and permanent errors (with some limitations) on AV safety and reliability.},

Due to the inherently compute- and power-intensive structure of Neural Networks (NNs), hardware accelerators emerge as a promising solution. However, with technology node scaling below 10nm, hardware accelerators become more susceptible to faults, which in turn can impact the NN accuracy. In this paper, we study the resilience aspects of Register-Transfer Level (RTL) model of NN accelerators, in particular, fault characterization and mitigation. By following a High-Level Synthesis (HLS) approach, first, we characterize the vulnerability of various components of RTL NN. We observed that the severity of faults depends on both i) application-level specifications, i.e., NN data (inputs, weights, or intermediate), NN layers, and NN activation functions, and ii) architectural-level specifications, i.e., data representation model and the parallelism degree of the underlying accelerator. Second, motivated by characterization results, we present a low-overhead fault mitigation technique that can efficiently correct bit flips, by 47.3{\%} better than state-of-the-art methods.},

Specialized hardware accelerators have been proposed to accelerate the execu- tion ofDNNalgorithms for high-performance and energy efficiency. Recently, they have been deployed in datacenters (potentially for business-critical or industrial applications) and safety-critical sys- tems such as self-driving cars. Soft errors caused by high-energy particles have been increasing in hardware systems, and these can lead to catastrophic failures in DNN systems. Traditional methods for building resilient systems, e.g., Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR), are agnostic of the DNN algorithm and the DNN acceler- ator's architecture. Hence, these traditional resilience approaches incur high overheads, which makes them challenging to deploy. In this paper, we experimentally evaluate the resilience characteris- tics of DNN systems (i.e., DNN software running on specialized accelerators). We find that the error resilience of a DNN system depends on the data types, values, data reuses, and types of layers in the design.

abstract = {This paper presents a 28-nm system-on-chip (SoC) for Internet of things (IoT) applications with a programmable accelerator design that implements a powerful fully connected deep neural network (DNN) classifier. To reach the required low energy consumption, we exploit the key properties of neural network algorithms: parallelism, data reuse, small/sparse data, and noise tolerance. We map the algorithm to a very large scale integration (VLSI) architecture based around an single-instruction, multiple-data data path with hardware support to exploit data sparsity by completely eliding unnecessary computation and data movement. This approach exploits sparsity, without compromising the parallel computation. We also exploit the inherent algorithmic noise-tolerance of neural networks, by introducing circuit-level timing violation detection to allow worst case voltage guard-bands to be minimized. The resulting intermittent timing violations may result in logic errors, which conventionally need to be corrected. However, in lieu of explicit error correction, we cope with this by accentuating the noise tolerance of neural networks.
