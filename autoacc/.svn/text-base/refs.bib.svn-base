In this paper, an automated parallel compilation environment for multiple soft processors which incorporates parallel compilation and inter-processor communication structures is described. A total of eight previously-developed parallel processing benchmarks have been automatically mapped to a varying number of synthesized soft microprocessors in commercial FPGAs. The new automated infrastructure allows for an evaluation of area, performance, and power tradeoffs for a range of architectural choices. Experiments show that our soft-multiprocessor systems consisting of up to 16 processors can offer up to 5Ã improvement in application performance against their uniprocessor counterparts.},

Our long-term vision is to have a unified programming paradigm for accelerators - regardless of whether they are FPGA or GPU based. While others have explored this from a high level hardware synthesis perspective, we chose to adopt the approach of a parametrically reconfigurable softcore. We will discuss the main architecture features of Guppy, compare its performance to the original core. Our design has been synthesized on a Xilinx Virtex 5 FPGA.},

abstract={We propose the use of a novel architecture, called the multi-level computing architecture (MLCA) to efficiently exploit coarse-grain parallelism on FPGAs. The central component of the MLCA is its control processor (CP), which is analogous to an out-of-order scheduling unit of a superscalar processor. The CP schedules coarse-grain units of computation, or tasks, onto processing units (PUs). In this paper, we explore the FPGA implementation of the CP and demonstrate the scalability of the MLCA for multimedia applications. We design, test and evaluate an 8-PU MLCA system. Our evaluation using 4 realistic multimedia applications indicates that the applications exhibit good scalability up to 8 PUs. Furthermore, the evaluation indicates that our CP design poses no bottlenecks to performance and has little overhead in terms of resource usage.},

abstract={A major issue facing the widespread use of FPGAs as accelerators is their programmability wall: the difficulty of hardware design and the long synthesis times. Overlays-pre-synthesized FPGA circuits that are themselves reconfigurable - promise to tackle these challenges. We design and evaluate an overlay architecture, structured as a mesh of functional units, for pipelined execution of data-flow graphs (DFGs), a common abstraction for expressing parallelism in applications. We use data-driven execution based on elastic pipelines to balance pipeline latencies and achieve a high fMAX, scalability and maximum throughput. We prototype two overlays on a Stratix IV FPGA: a 355 MHz 24×16 integer overlay and a 312 MHz 18×16 floating-point overlay. We also design a tool that maps DFGs to overlays. We map 15 DFGs and show that the two overlays deliver throughputs of up to 35 GOPS and 22 GFLOPS, respectively. We also show that DFG mapping is fast, taking no more than 6 seconds for the largest DFG. Thus, our overlay architecture raises the level of abstraction of FPGA programming closer to that of software and avoids lengthy synthesis time, easing the use of these devices to accelerate applications.},

abstract={As embedded systems designers increasingly use field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) while pursuing single-chip designs, they are motivated to have their designs also include soft processors, processors built using FPGA programmable logic. In this paper, we provide: 1) an exploration of the microarchitectural tradeoffs for soft processors and 2) a set of customization techniques that capitalizes on these tradeoffs to improve the efficiency of soft processors for specific applications. Using our infrastructure for automatically generating soft-processor implementations (which span a large area/speed design space while remaining competitive with Altera's Nios II variations), we quantify tradeoffs within soft-processor microarchitecture and explore the impact of tuning the microarchitecture to the application. In addition, we apply a technique of subsetting the instruction set to use only the portion utilized by the application. Through these two techniques, we can improve the performance-per-area of a soft processor for a specific application by an average of 25%},

abstract={Custom instruction set extensions can substantially boost performance of reconfigurable softcore CPUs. While this approach is commonly tailored to one specific FPGA system, we are presenting a fine-grained FPGA-like overlay architecture which can be implemented in the user logic of various FPGA families from different vendors. This allows the execution of a portable application consisting of a program binary and an overlay configuration in a completely heterogeneous environment. Furthermore, we are presenting different optimizations for dramatically reducing the implementation cost of the proposed overlay architecture. In particular, this includes the mapping of the overlay interconnection network directly into the switch fabric of the hosting FPGA. Our case study demonstrates an overhead reduction of an order of magnitude as compared to related approaches.},
