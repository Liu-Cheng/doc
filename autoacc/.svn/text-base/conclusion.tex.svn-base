\section{conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we have presented an automatic nested loop acceleration 
framework based on a homogeneous SCGRA overlay built on top of 
off-the-shelf FPGA devices. Given high level user constraints and design goals, 
the framework performs an intensive system customization specifically 
to a nested loop. When the optimized design configuration is 
acquired after the customization, the HDL model of the resulting accelerator  
as well as the communication interface can be generated. Finally, the accelerator 
and the software running on the host CPU can further be compiled rapidly to 
the hybrid CPU-FPGA system.

Particularly, by taking advantage of the regularity of 
the SCGRA overlay, various metrics of the accelerator such as overhead 
and energy consumption can be effectively evaluated via analytical models. 
This unique characteristic allows us to reduce the complex system 
customization to a simpler sub design space exploration and a 
straightforward search over the sub design space. Compared to an 
exhaustive search through the entire design space, the proposed 
two-step customization method reduces runtime by 2 orders of magnitude 
on average while achieving quite similar energy-performance Pareto-optimal 
curve and the same customized architecture that produces 
minimum energy consumption. When compared to the implementations using 
a state-of-the-art HLS tool, the customized design exhibits competitive 
performance.
