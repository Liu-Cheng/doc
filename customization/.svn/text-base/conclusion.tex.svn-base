\section{conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we have presented an automatic SCGRA overlay customization framework for nested loop acceleration on a hybrid CPU-FPGA system.
By utilizing a marginal performance revenue metric, it effectively prunes the design space to a small feasible region. In the feasible design space, customization for different design goals can be obtained rapidly. 
When compared to an exhaustive search, the proposed customization framework reduces run time by 2
orders of magnitude on average while achieving comparable Pareto-optimal in performance-overhead
tradeoff and the same customized architecture that results in minimum energy and minimum energy-delay product.
