@inproceedings{zuma2012,
	Abstract = {This paper presents the ZUMA open FPGA overlay architecture. It is an open-source,
        cross-compatible embedded FPGA architecture that is intended to overlay on top of an
            existing FPGA, in essence an ''FPGA-on-an-FPGA.'' This approach has a number of benefits,
        including bitstream compatibility between different vendors and parts, compatibility with
            open FPGA tool Hows, and the ability to embed some programmable logic into systems on
            FPGAs without the need for releasing or recompiling the master netlist. These options
            can enhance design possibilities and improve designer productivity. Previous attempts to
            map an FPGA architecture into a commercial FPGA have had an area penalty of 100x at best
            [4]. Through careful architectural and implementation choices to exploit low-level
            elements of the host architecture, ZUMA reduces this penalty to as low as 40x. Using the
            VTR (VPR6) academic tool How, we have been able to compile the entire MCNC benchmark
            suite to ZUMA. We invite authors of other tool Hows to target ZUMA.},

In this paper, an automated parallel compilation environment for multiple soft processors which incorporates parallel compilation and inter-processor communication structures is described. A total of eight previously-developed parallel processing benchmarks have been automatically mapped to a varying number of synthesized soft microprocessors in commercial FPGAs. The new automated infrastructure allows for an evaluation of area, performance, and power tradeoffs for a range of architectural choices. Experiments show that our soft-multiprocessor systems consisting of up to 16 processors can offer up to 5{\~A} improvement in application performance against their uniprocessor counterparts.},

VENICE differs from previous SVPs in that it was designed for maximum throughput with a small number (1 to 4) of ALUs. By increasing clockspeed and eliminating bottlenecks in ALU utilization, VENICE can achieve over 2x better performance-per-logic block than VEGAS, the previous best SVP. While VENICE can scale to a large number of ALUs, a multiprocessor system of smaller VENICE SVPs is shown to scale better for benchmarks with limited innerloop parallelism. VENICE is also simpler to program, as its instructions use standard C pointers into a scratchpad memory rather than vector registers.},

@inproceedings{Shukla2006QUKU,
	Abstract = {FPGAs have been used for prototyping of ASICs, for low-volume ASIC replacement and for systems requiring in-field hardware upgrades. However, the potential to use dynamic reconfiguration to adapt FPGA operation to changing application requirements has been hampered by slow reconfiguration times, and poor CAD tool support. In this paper, a new architecture, QUKU (pronounced cuckoo), is described which uses a coarse-grained reconfigurable PE array (CGRA) overlaid on an FPGA. The low-speed reconfigurability of the FPGA is used to optimize the CGRA for different applications, while the high-speed CGRA reconfiguration is used within an application for operator re-use. An FIR filter kernel has been implemented on QUKU and is shown to have performance which bridges the gap between softcore CPUs and custom FPGA filter circuits},

While others have explored this from a high level hardware synthesis perspective, we chose to adopt the approach of a parametrically reconfigurable softcore. We will discuss the main architecture features of Guppy, compare its performance to the original core. Our design has been synthesized on a Xilinx Virtex 5 FPGA.},

The central component of the MLCA is its control processor (CP), which is analogous to an out-of-order scheduling unit of a superscalar processor. The CP schedules coarse-grain units of computation, or tasks, onto processing units (PUs). In this paper, we explore the FPGA implementation of the CP and demonstrate the scalability of the MLCA for multimedia applications. We design, test and evaluate an 8-PU MLCA system. Our evaluation using 4 realistic multimedia applications indicates that the applications exhibit good scalability up to 8 PUs. Furthermore, the evaluation indicates that our CP design poses no bottlenecks to performance and has little overhead in terms of resource usage.},

Overlays-pre-synthesized FPGA circuits that are themselves reconfigurable - promise to tackle these challenges. We design and evaluate an overlay architecture, structured as a mesh of functional units, for pipelined execution of data-flow graphs (DFGs), a common abstraction for expressing parallelism in applications. We use data-driven execution based on elastic pipelines to balance pipeline latencies and achieve a high fMAX, scalability and maximum throughput. We prototype two overlays on a Stratix IV FPGA: a 355 MHz 24×16 integer overlay and a 312 MHz 18×16 floating-point overlay. We also design a tool that maps DFGs to overlays. We map 15 DFGs and show that the two overlays deliver throughputs of up to 35 GOPS and 22 GFLOPS, respectively. We also show that DFG mapping is fast, taking no more than 6 seconds for the largest DFG. Thus, our overlay architecture raises the level of abstraction of FPGA programming closer to that of software and avoids lengthy synthesis time, easing the use of these devices to accelerate applications.},

@article{Yiannacouras2007Exploration,
	Abstract = {As embedded systems designers increasingly use field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) while pursuing single-chip designs, they are motivated to have their designs also include soft processors, processors built using FPGA programmable logic. In this paper, we provide: 1) an exploration of the microarchitectural tradeoffs for soft processors and 2) a set of customization techniques that capitalizes on these tradeoffs to improve the efficiency of soft processors for specific applications. Using our infrastructure for automatically generating soft-processor implementations (which span a large area/speed design space while remaining competitive with Altera's Nios II variations), we quantify tradeoffs within soft-processor microarchitecture and explore the impact of tuning the microarchitecture to the application. In addition, we apply a technique of subsetting the instruction set to use only the portion utilized by the application. Through these two techniques, we can improve the performance-per-area of a soft processor for a specific application by an average of 25%},

While this approach is commonly tailored to one specific FPGA system, we are presenting a fine-grained FPGA-like overlay architecture which can be implemented in the user logic of various FPGA families from different vendors. This allows the execution of a portable application consisting of a program binary and an overlay configuration in a completely heterogeneous environment. Furthermore, we are presenting different optimizations for dramatically reducing the implementation cost of the proposed overlay architecture. In particular, this includes the mapping of the overlay interconnection network directly into the switch fabric of the hosting FPGA. Our case study demonstrates an overhead reduction of an order of magnitude as compared to related approaches.},

@inproceedings{Coole2010Intermediate,
	Abstract = {Although hardware/software partitioning of embedded applications onto FPGAs is widely known to have performance and power advantages, FPGA usage has been typically limited to hardware experts, due largely to several problems: 1) difficulty of integrating hardware design tools into well-established software tool flows, 2) increasingly lengthy FPGA design iterations due to placement and routing, and 3) a lack of portability and interoperability resulting from device/platform-specific tools and bitfiles. In this paper, we directly address the last two problems by introducing intermediate fabrics, which are virtual reconfigurable architectures specialized for different application domains, implemented on top of commercial-off-the-shelf devices. Such specialization enables near-instantaneous placement and routing by hiding the complexity of fine-grained physical devices, while also enabling circuit portability across all devices that implement the intermediate fabric. When combined with existing work on runtime synthesis from software binaries, intermediate fabrics reduce the effects of all three problems by enabling transparent usage of COTS FPGAs by software designers. In this paper, we explore intermediate fabric architectures using specialization techniques to minimize area and performance overhead of the virtual fabric while maximizing routability and speedup of placement and routing. We present results showing an average placement and routing speedup of 554×, with an average area overhead of 10\% and clock overhead of 18\%, which corresponds to an average frequency of 195 MHz.},

	Abstract = {This paper briefly reviews the forces that caused the power problem, the solutions that were applied, and what the solutions tell us about the problem. As systems became more power constrained, optimizing the power became more critical; viewing power reduction from an optimization perspective provides valuable insights. Section III describes these insights in more detail, including why Vdd and Vth have stopped scaling. Section IV describes some of the low power techniques that have been used in the past in the context of the optimization framework. This framework also makes it easy to see the impact of variability, which is discussed in more detail in section V along with the adaptive mechanisms that have been proposed and deployed to minimize the energy cost. Section VI describes possible strategies for dealing with the slowdown in gate energy scaling, and the final section concludes by discussing the implications of these strategies for device designers.},

@article{JChen08,
	Abstract = {Heterogeneous multi-core processors are attractive for power efficient computing because of their ability to meet varied resource requirements of diverse applications in a workload. However, one of the challenges of using a heterogeneous multi-core processor is to schedule different programs in a workload to matching cores that can deliver the most efficient program execution. This paper presents an energy-aware scheduling mechanism that employs fuzzy logic to calculate the suitability between programs and cores by analyzing important inherent program characteristics such as instruction dependency distance and branch transition rate. The obtained suitability is then used to guide the program scheduling in the heterogeneous multi-core system. The experimental results show that the proposed suitability-guided program scheduling mechanism achieves up to 15.0\% average reduction in energy-delay product compared with that of the random scheduling approach. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to apply fuzzy logic to schedule programs in heterogeneous multi-core systems.},

The first prototypes were manufactured on the Atmel ATC35 0.35 $\mu$m CMOS process, and subjected to heavy-ion fault-injection at the Louvain Cyclotron. The heavy-ion tests showed that all of the injected errors (>100,000) were successfully corrected without timing or software impact. The device SEU threshold was measured to be below 6 MeV while ion energy-levels of up to 110 MeV were used for error injection.},

This is because applications like digital video cameras, cellular phones etc. draw their current from batteries that spend a limited amount of energy only. In this paper we show that energy-conscious HW/SW-partitioning can lead to drastic reductions of energy dissipation of a whole embedded system. Subject of investigation is an MPEG-2 encoder. Therefore, we introduce our framework for estimating and optimizing system energy as well as all conducted design steps. The obtained results show energy savings up 59\% while the performance remains approximately the same or becomes even slightly higher. As a main result, energy-conscious HW/SW-partitioning is a promising method to be deployed in addition to classical energy and/or power reduction methods},

A logic delay measurement circuit (LDMC) is used to determine the speed of an inverter chain for various operating conditions at run time. A desired LDMC value, intended to match the critical path of the operating circuit plus a safety margin, is then chosen; a closed loop control scheme is used to maintain the desired LDMC value as chip temperature changes, by automatically adjusting the voltage applied to the FPGA. We describe experiments using this technique on various circuits at different clock frequencies and temperatures to demonstrate its utility and robustness.

In this paper, we survey several approaches to system-level dynamic power management. We first describe how systems employ power-manageable components and how the use of dynamic reconfiguration can impact the overall power consumption. We then analyze DPM implementation issues in electronic systems, and we survey recent initiatives in standardizing the hardware/software interface to enable software-controlled power management of hardware components},

	Abstract = {This paper presents experimental measurements of the differences between a 90-nm CMOS field programmable gate array (FPGA) and 90-nm CMOS standard-cell application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) in terms of logic density, circuit speed, and power consumption for core logic. We are motivated to make these measurements to enable system designers to make better informed choices between these two media and to give insight to FPGA makers on the deficiencies to attack and, thereby, improve FPGAs. We describe the methodology by which the measurements were obtained and show that, for circuits containing only look-up table-based logic and flip-flops, the ratio of silicon area required to implement them in FPGAs and ASICs is on average 35. Modern FPGAs also contain "hard" blocks such as multiplier/accumulators and block memories. We find that these blocks reduce this average area gap significantly to as little as 18 for our benchmarks, and we estimate that extensive use of these hard blocks could potentially lower the gap to below five. The ratio of critical-path delay, from FPGA to ASIC, is roughly three to four with less influence from block memory and hard multipliers. The dynamic power consumption ratio is approximately 14 times and, with hard blocks, this gap generally becomes smaller},

@article{Kasap:2012,
	Abstract = {The design and implementation of an FPGA core that parallelises all the necessary operations to compute the non-bonded interactions in a MD simulation with the purpose of accelarating the LAMMPS MD software is presented in this paper. Our MD processor core comprised of 4 identical pipelines working independently in parallel to evaluate the non-bonded potentials, forces and virials was implemented on the nodes of a FPGA-based supercomputer named Maxwell. Implementing our FPGA core on multiple nodes of Maxwell allowed us to produce a special-purpose parallel machine for the hardware acceleration of MD simulations. The timing performance figures of this machine for the pairwise LJ and short-range Coulombic (via PPPM) interaction computations in the MD simulations of the solvated Rhodopsin protein systems with various numbers of atom show performance gains over the pure software implementation by factors of up to 13 on two nodes of the Maxwell machine. Furthermore, our MD machine is highly scalable, yielding higher computational power with the additional Maxwell nodes. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to port an existing production-grade MD software to a FPGA-based parallel computer.},

	Abstract = {To cope with the complexity of programming GPU accelerators for medical imaging computations, we developed a framework to describe image processing kernels in a domain-specific language, which is embedded into C++. The description uses decoupled access/execute metadata, which allow the programmer to specify both execution constraints and memory access patterns of kernels. A source-to-source compiler translates this high-level description into low-level CUDA and Open CL code with automatic support for boundary handling and filter masks. Taking the annotated metadata and the characteristics of the parallel GPU execution model into account, two-layered parallel implementations - utilizing SPMD and MPMD parallelism - are generated. An abstract hardware model of graphics card architectures allows to model GPUs of multiple vendors like AMD and NVIDIA, and to generate device-specific code for multiple targets. It is shown that the generated code is faster than manual implementations and those relying on hardware support for boundary handling. Implementations from Rapid Mind, a commercial framework for GPU programming, are outperformed and similar results achieved compared to the GPU backend of the widely used image processing library Open CV.},

	Abstract = {The development of high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) at the single-cell level has already led to profound new discoveries in biology, ranging from the identification of novel cell types to the study of global patterns of stochastic gene expression. Alongside the technological breakthroughs that have facilitated the large-scale generation of single-cell transcriptomic data, it is important to consider the specific computational and analytical challenges that still have to be overcome. Although some tools for analysing RNA-seq data from bulk cell populations can be readily applied to single-cell RNA-seq data, many new computational strategies are required to fully exploit this data type and to enable a comprehensive yet detailed study of gene expression at the single-cell level.},

	Abstract = {Optical microscopy is one of the most widely used diagnostic methods in scientific, industrial, and biomedical applications. However, while useful for detailed examination of a small number (< 10,000) of microscopic entities, conventional optical microscopy is incapable of statistically relevant screening of large populations (> 100,000,000) with high precision due to its low throughput and limited digital memory size. We present an automated flow-through single-particle optical microscope that overcomes this limitation by performing sensitive blur-free image acquisition and nonstop real-time image-recording and classification of microparticles during high-speed flow. This is made possible by integrating ultrafast optical imaging technology, self-focusing microfluidic technology, optoelectronic communication technology, and information technology. To show the system's utility, we demonstrate high-throughput image-based screening of budding yeast and rare breast cancer cells in blood with an unprecedented throughput of 100,000 particles/s and a record false positive rate of one in a million.},
