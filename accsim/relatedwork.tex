Simulator is of vital importance for accelerator design and exploration especially in 
early design stage. While many accelerator may involve considerable memory access, a memory 
model should be included in the simulator as well. Although there have been a number of 
different open-source high-level memory models developed, these memory models are usually developed 
targeting general computer architectures or memory architectures and can not be easily 
adapted to a specific accelerator. As a result, developing an 
accelerator simulator with integrated memory model still takes quite a lot 
of design efforts. 

EDA vendors such as Xilinx, Altera and Synopsys also provide accurate memory models 
as well as ample IPs which are convenient for accelerator development. However, these facilities 
are mostly used together with a hardware description language (HDL) model for prototyping or 
fabrication on ASICs. And it takes long time to develop the accelerator and the resulting design 
is usually not flexible for accelerator architecture exploration. In addition, they typically 
support only mature DDRx and LPDDRx models and don't cover novel and emerging memory architectures.
As a result, this also limits the exploration of the accelerator architectural exploration.

In this work, we developed a flexible accelerator simulation framework for accelerator 
simulator design and exploration. It wrapps up the ramulator such that various memory 
models are supported and frequent memory interfaces are provided. In addition, it also 
allows trade-off between the simulation speed and precision. With this feature, accelerators 
operating on large data set can also be simulated with moderate accuracy and simulation time.
