The QuickDough design framework is presented as a way to address productivity issues of developing
high-performance FPGA accelerators. QuickDough utilizes a soft coarse-grained reconfigurable array
(SCGRA) as an overlay on top of off-the-shelf FPGAs for rapid accelerator developments.
Instead of compiling high-level applications directly to HDL circuits, the compilation step is
reduced to a simpler operation scheduling task targeting the SCGRA overlay, significantly reducing
compilation time and increasing possible numbers of debug-cycle-per-day as a result.
The softness of the SCGRA allows highly customized application-specific design while the regular
structure of the SCGRA makes the customization much easier. When compared to the
execution on a general purposed processor, the accelerators generated using QuickDough achieves up
to 9X performance speedup.
