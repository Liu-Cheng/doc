\begin{rSection}{Experience}

\begin{rSubsection}{SenseTime Group Limited}{Apr 2016 - present}{Project: Convolutional Neural Network
    (CNN) acceleration on Zynq}{}
\item I have developed a flexible hardware accelerator for general convolution layer of CNN. It allows
arbitrary tiling and striding for various CNN configuration. Unfortunately, it is not adopted in the
latest product due to the resource consumption. In this project, I am also responsible for the CNN
ip driver development and the linux kernel customization.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{The University of Hong Kong}{Sep 2011 - Dec 2015}{Research Project: promoting FPGA design productivity using soft CGRA overlay}{}
\item In this project, a rapid FPGA loop accelerator design framework was developed. By using a
    regular soft coarse-grained reconfigurable array (SCGRA) overlay as an intermediate layer, it is
    able to compile a high-level (C/C++) nested loop to an FPGA loop accelerator bitstream in
    seconds. Meanwhile, it targets a hybrid CPU-FPGA system and the communication interface between
    the CPU and the resulting FPGA accelerator is also generated automatically making it accessible
    to software designers. In addition, the overlay allows intensive customization specifically to
    an application or a domain of applications for the sake of performance.

\begin{rSubsection}{Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences}{Sep 2009 - Mar 2011}{Research Project: highly reliable network-on-chip design}{}
\item This project aimed to enhance NoC reliability by innovating on NoC micro-architecture. With
    the observation that Vertical Through Silicon Vias (TSV) in a classical 3D NoC is
    under-utilized, a TSV sharing method was developed for homogeneous 3D NoC with negligible 2D area
    overhead. This can either be used to improve the reliability of 3D NoC or shrink the TSV consumption.
    For regular 2D NoC, a flexible data path salvaging scheme was proposed to build highly reliable NoC.

\begin{rSubsection}{Harbin Institute of Technology}{Oct 2006 - Jul 2009}{Research Project: high performance network-on-chip design}{}
\item This project aimed to improve NoC performance as well as power efficiency. A number a design
optimization methods were implemented for this purpose: 1) A delicate virtual channel assignment was
used to improve NoC performance and remove the deadlock in adaptive routing. 2) A lightweight
dynamic virtual channel sharing architecture was implemented to reduce the chip area as well as the
power consumption. 3) With the observation that NoC components have quite low utilization, a dynamic
power gating scheme was developed to enhance NoC power efficiency.
