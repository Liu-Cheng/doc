abstract = "A light-weight software-implemented fault injection (SWIFI) testing approach is introduced, focusing on technical process faults and system faults. The reaction of automated production systems (aPSs) and their programmable logic controller (PLC) software to these faults is tested. In order to tailor the testing approach to the aPS domain in industrial practice, our test generation is based on a classification of possible deviations, i.e. a classification of possible technical process and system faults as the PLC perceives them. As a result, both specification and test execution become more efficient for practitioners. Furthermore, the test specification is tailored for execution on IEC 61131-3 programming environments. In this, the execution of test cases both against simulation or the real aPS, is enabled."
