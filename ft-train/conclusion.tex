\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose to take the CNN accelerator’s ‘undeterministic’ behaviors into consideration 
at training and have the CNN model to learn the accelerator’s behaviors. To that end, we further build 
an open-sourced training system based on Caffe on a hybrid CPU-FPGA architecture. Then use the training 
system to deal with an overclocked CNN accelerator and an accelerator with soft errors. According to our 
experiments, the proposed training can improve the prediction accuracy of four CNN models up to 3.4\% when 
the CNN accelerator is overclocked on the extreme situation. This method is also beneficial to the CNN 
accelerators with soft errors. In the case with most soft errors, it improves the prediction accuracy up 
to 6.8\% and by 3.58\% on average. The disadvantage is the much longer training time due to the frequent 
data transfer between host memory and device memory. This problem can be resolved when porting the system 
to closely coupled CPU-FPGA architectures with shared memory.
