By increasing clockspeed and eliminating bottlenecks in ALU utilization, VENICE can achieve over 2x better performance-per-logic block than VEGAS, the previous best SVP. While VENICE can scale to a large number of ALUs, a multiprocessor system of smaller VENICE SVPs is shown to scale better for benchmarks with limited innerloop parallelism. VENICE is also simpler to program, as its instructions use standard C pointers into a scratchpad memory rather than vector registers.},

abstract={FPGAs have been used for prototyping of ASICs, for low-volume ASIC replacement and for systems requiring in-field hardware upgrades. However, the potential to use dynamic reconfiguration to adapt FPGA operation to changing application requirements has been hampered by slow reconfiguration times, and poor CAD tool support. In this paper, a new architecture, QUKU (pronounced cuckoo), is described which uses a coarse-grained reconfigurable PE array (CGRA) overlaid on an FPGA. The low-speed reconfigurability of the FPGA is used to optimize the CGRA for different applications, while the high-speed CGRA reconfiguration is used within an application for operator re-use. An FIR filter kernel has been implemented on QUKU and is shown to have performance which bridges the gap between softcore CPUs and custom FPGA filter circuits},

The CP schedules coarse-grain units of computation, or tasks, onto processing units (PUs). In this paper, we explore the FPGA implementation of the CP and demonstrate the scalability of the MLCA for multimedia applications. We design, test and evaluate an 8-PU MLCA system. Our evaluation using 4 realistic multimedia applications indicates that the applications exhibit good scalability up to 8 PUs. Furthermore, the evaluation indicates that our CP design poses no bottlenecks to performance and has little overhead in terms of resource usage.},

abstract={A major issue facing the widespread use of FPGAs as accelerators is their programmability wall: the difficulty of hardware design and the long synthesis times. Overlays-pre-synthesized FPGA circuits that are themselves reconfigurable - promise to tackle these challenges. We design and evaluate an overlay architecture, structured as a mesh of functional units, for pipelined execution of data-flow graphs (DFGs), a common abstraction for expressing parallelism in applications. We use data-driven execution based on elastic pipelines to balance pipeline latencies and achieve a high fMAX, scalability and maximum throughput. We prototype two overlays on a Stratix IV FPGA: a 355 MHz 24×16 integer overlay and a 312 MHz 18×16 floating-point overlay. We also design a tool that maps DFGs to overlays. We map 15 DFGs and show that the two overlays deliver throughputs of up to 35 GOPS and 22 GFLOPS, respectively. We also show that DFG mapping is fast, taking no more than 6 seconds for the largest DFG. Thus, our overlay architecture raises the level of abstraction of FPGA programming closer to that of software and avoids lengthy synthesis time, easing the use of these devices to accelerate applications.},

Using our infrastructure for automatically generating soft-processor implementations (which span a large area/speed design space while remaining competitive with Altera's Nios II variations), we quantify tradeoffs within soft-processor microarchitecture and explore the impact of tuning the microarchitecture to the application. In addition, we apply a technique of subsetting the instruction set to use only the portion utilized by the application. Through these two techniques, we can improve the performance-per-area of a soft processor for a specific application by an average of 25%},

While this approach is commonly tailored to one specific FPGA system, we are presenting a fine-grained FPGA-like overlay architecture which can be implemented in the user logic of various FPGA families from different vendors. This allows the execution of a portable application consisting of a program binary and an overlay configuration in a completely heterogeneous environment. Furthermore, we are presenting different optimizations for dramatically reducing the implementation cost of the proposed overlay architecture. In particular, this includes the mapping of the overlay interconnection network directly into the switch fabric of the hosting FPGA. Our case study demonstrates an overhead reduction of an order of magnitude as compared to related approaches.},

year={2010}, 
month={Oct}, 
pages={13-22}, 
abstract={Although hardware/software partitioning of embedded applications onto FPGAs is widely known to have performance and power advantages, FPGA usage has been typically limited to hardware experts, due largely to several problems: 1) difficulty of integrating hardware design tools into well-established software tool flows, 2) increasingly lengthy FPGA design iterations due to placement and routing, and 3) a lack of portability and interoperability resulting from device/platform-specific tools and bitfiles. In this paper, we directly address the last two problems by introducing intermediate fabrics, which are virtual reconfigurable architectures specialized for different application domains, implemented on top of commercial-off-the-shelf devices. Such specialization enables near-instantaneous placement and routing by hiding the complexity of fine-grained physical devices, while also enabling circuit portability across all devices that implement the intermediate fabric. When combined with existing work on runtime synthesis from software binaries, intermediate fabrics reduce the effects of all three problems by enabling transparent usage of COTS FPGAs by software designers. In this paper, we explore intermediate fabric architectures using specialization techniques to minimize area and performance overhead of the virtual fabric while maximizing routability and speedup of placement and routing. We present results showing an average placement and routing speedup of 554×, with an average area overhead of 10\% and clock overhead of 18\%, which corresponds to an average frequency of 195 MHz.},

abstract={Although soft microprocessors are widely used in FPGAs, limited work has been performed regarding how to automatically and efficiently generate soft multiprocessors. In this paper, an automated parallel compilation environment for multiple soft processors which incorporates parallel compilation and inter-processor communication structures is described. A total of eight previously-developed parallel processing benchmarks have been automatically mapped to a varying number of synthesized soft microprocessors in commercial FPGAs. The new automated infrastructure allows for an evaluation of area, performance, and power tradeoffs for a range of architectural choices. Experiments show that our soft-multiprocessor systems consisting of up to 16 processors can offer up to 5Ã improvement in application performance against their uniprocessor counterparts.},

abstract={We propose the use of a novel architecture, called the multi-level computing architecture (MLCA) to efficiently exploit coarse-grain parallelism on FPGAs. The central component of the MLCA is its control processor (CP), which is analogous to an out-of-order scheduling unit of a superscalar processor. The CP schedules coarse-grain units of computation, or tasks, onto processing units (PUs). In this paper, we explore the FPGA implementation of the CP and demonstrate the scalability of the MLCA for multimedia applications. We design, test and evaluate an 8-PU MLCA system. Our evaluation using 4 realistic multimedia applications indicates that the applications exhibit good scalability up to 8 PUs. Furthermore, the evaluation indicates that our CP design poses no bottlenecks to performance and has little overhead in terms of resource usage.},
