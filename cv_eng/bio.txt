Abstract:
Developing applications that run on FPGAs is without doubt a very different 
experience from writing programs in software. Not only is the hardware design 
process fundamentally different from that of software development, software 
programmers also often find themselves constantly battling with the much lower 
design productivity in developing hardware designs. FPGA overlay, which is a 
virtual reconfigurable architecture overlaying on top of the physical FPGA 
configurable fabrics is generating a lot of excitements because of their 
potentials to address the design productivity problem and is gaining 
traction among researchers recently.

In this talk, I will present a soft coarse grained reconfigurable array (SCGRA) 
overlay based loop accelerator generation framework named QuickDough.
It targets typical CPU-FPGA architectures and is able to produce hardware 
accelerators rapidly. Given a user-designated loop for acceleration, 
QuickDough automatically generates and optimizes the corresponding hardware 
accelerator and its associated data I/O facilities with the host software.
