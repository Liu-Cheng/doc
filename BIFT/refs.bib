    abstract = {A model describing the maximum clock frequency (FMAX) distribution of a microprocessor is derived and compared with wafer sort data for a recent 0.25-&mu;m microprocessor. The model agrees closely with measured data in mean, variance, and shape. Results demonstrate that within-die fluctuations primarily impact the FMAX mean and die-to-die fluctuations determine the majority of the FMAX variance. Employing rigorously derived device and circuit
        models, the impact of die-to-die and within-die parameter fluctuations on future FMAX distributions is forecast for the 180, 130, 100, 70, and 50-nm technology generations. Model predictions reveal that systematic within-die fluctuations impose the largest performance degradation resulting from parameter fluctuations. Assuming a 3&sigma; channel length deviation of 20%, projections for the 50-nm technology generation indicate that essentially a generation
            of performance gain can be lost due to systematic within-die fluctuations. Key insights from this work elucidate the recommendations that manufacturing process controls be targeted specifically toward sources of systematic within-die fluctuations, and the development of new circuit design methodologies be aimed at suppressing the effect of within-die parameter fluctuations},

We demonstrate that in a CMOS inverter circuit, the interface traps generated under NBTI stressing in a p-MOSFET (corresponding to the "high" output state of the inverter) are subsequently passivated when the gate to drain voltage switches to positive (corresponding to the "low" output state of the inverter). As a result, it was found that this "Dynamic" NBTI (DNBTI) operating
        in a CMOS inverter circuit prolongs significantly the device lifetime while the conventional "static" NBTI (SNBTI) underestimates the device lifetime. Furthermore, the DNBTI effect is dependent on temperature and gate oxide thickness, but independent of operation frequency. A physical model is proposed for DNBTI that involves the interaction between hydrogen and silicon dangling bonds. This finding has significant impact on the determination of maximum operation
            voltage as well as lifetime projection for future scaling of CMOS devices.},

    pages = {520-531},
    abstract = {Increased power densities (and resultant temperatures) and other effects of device scaling are predicted to cause significant lifetime reliability problems in the near future. In this paper, we study two techniques that leverage microarchitectural structural redundancy for lifetime reliability enhancement. First, in structural duplication (SD), redundant microarchitectural structures are added to the processor and designated as spares. Spare structures
        can be turned on when the original structure fails, increasing the processor's lifetime. Second, graceful performance degradation (GPD) is a technique which exploits existing microarchitectural redundancy for reliability. Redundant structures that fail are shut down while still maintaining functionality, thereby increasing the processor's lifetime, but at a lower performance. Our analysis shows that exploiting structural redundancy can provide significant
            reliability benefits, and we present guidelines for efficient usage of these techniques by identifying situations where each is more beneficial. We show that GPD is the superior technique when only limited performance or cost resources can be sacrificed for reliability. Specifically, on average for our systems and applications, GPD increased processor reliability to 1.42 times the base value for less than a 5% loss in performance. On the other hand, for systems
            where reliability is more important than performance or cost, SD is more beneficial. SD increases reliability to 3.17 times the base value for 2.25 times the base cost, for our applications. Finally, a combination of the two techniques (SD+GPD) provides the highest reliability benefit.},

	ABSTRACT = {Motivated by the recently developed distillation approaches that aim to obtain small and fast-to-execute models, in this paper a novel Layer Selectivity Learning (LSL) framework is proposed for learning deep models. We firstly use an asymmetric dual-model learning framework, called Auxiliary Structure Learning (ASL), to train a small model with the help of a larger and well-trained model. Then, the intermediate layer selection scheme, called the Layer Selectivity Procedure (LSP), is exploited to determine the corresponding intermediate layers of source and target models. The LSP is achieved by two novel matrices, the layered inter-class Gram matrix and the inter-layered Gram matrix, to evaluate the diversity and discrimination of feature maps. The experimental results, demonstrated using three publicly available datasets, present the superior performance of model training using the LSL deep model learning framework.},

	abstract = {This work is oriented at the edge computing scenario that terminal deep learning accelerators use pre-trained neural network models distributed from third-party providers (e.g. from data center clouds) to process the private data instead of sending it to the cloud. In this scenario, the network model is exposed to the risk of being attacked in the unverified devices if the parameters and hyper-parameters are transmitted and processed in an unencrypted way. Our work tackles this security problem by using on-chip memory Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and Processing-In-Memory (PIM). We allow the model execution only on authorized devices and protect the model from white-box attacks, black-box attacks and model tampering attacks. The proposed PUFs-and-PIM based Protection method for neural Models (P3M), can utilize unstable PUFs to protect the neural models in edge deep learning accelerators with negligible performance overhead. The experimental results show considerable performance improvement over two state-of-the-art solutions we evaluated.},
