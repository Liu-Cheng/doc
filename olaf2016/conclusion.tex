\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper has presented an open-source soft processor that is tightly-coupled with an FPGA accelerator to become part of an FPGA overlay framework. RISC-V is chosen as the instruction set for its openness and portability, and the soft processor is designed as a 4-stage pipeline to minimize the resource consumption. % when implemented on FPGAs. 
Experiments show that, when compared with existing design, the proposed soft processor is small and efficient, and the tightly-coupled architecture can provide a unified programming model for software designers while at the same time maintaining certain performance. Furthermore, the processor is generically implemented so as to promote design portability and compatibility across different FPGA platforms.  It is anticipated that the proposed architecture can eventually improve the portability of FPGA overlays, and promote the use of FPGA among software developers.
