Compiling high level compute intensive nested loops to 
FPGAs via an abstract overlay has been demonstrated as an effective 
way to improve design productivity. However, achieving 
the desired performance and energy constraints requires intensive 
application-specific customization over a complex design space 
while the customization can be extremely time-consuming 
counteracting the benefit of utilizing the overlay as a 
design productivity enhancer. 
 
To address the above problem, we have developed a highly scalable and 
regular Soft CGRA (SCGRA) overlay as the backbone of the FPGA accelerators such 
that the design metrics such as implementation frequency, hardware 
overhead, and power consumption are highly predictable and analytical 
models can be easily built to evaluate the design metrics. 
With the analytical models, the complex application-specific 
customization targeting nested loop acceleration on FPGAs is reduced 
to a light-weight sub design space exploration centering the 
NP-complete SCGRA scheduling and a straightforward customization 
with all the potential configurations well estimated. According to the 
experiments, the proposed customization method achieves 
similar Pareto-optimal curves to that obtained using an 
exhaustive search with a fraction of runtime. When compiled to 
the implementations with best-effort optimization using 
off-the-shelf HLS design tools, the implementations using the 
proposed customization framework exhibit competitive performance and overhead.
