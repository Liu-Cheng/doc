\begin{abstract}
    Breadth First Search (BFS) is a key building block of graph processing 
	and there have been considerable efforts devoted to accelerating BFS on FPGAs
	for the sake of both performance and energy efficiency. Prior work 
	typically built the BFS accelerator through handcrafted circuit design using 
	hardware description language (HDL). Despite the relatively good performance, 
	the HDL based design leads to extremely low design productivity, and incurs 
	high portability and maintenance cost. While the evolving high level synthesis (HLS) 
	tools make it convenient to create a functional correct BFS accelerator, 
	the performance of the baseline design remains much lower. 

	To obtain both the near hand-crafted design performance and the software-like features, 
	we propose OBFS, an OpenCL based BFS accelerator on software programmable FPGAs, 
	and explore a series of high-level optimizations to the OpenCL design. 
	With the observation that OpenCL based FPGA design is rather inefficient on 
	irregular memory access (random and short burst), we focus on the optimization 
	of irregular memory access in BFS. 
	First of all, we convert the low-efficient irregular edge reading into batched 
	memory access with graph reordering. Then we use an on-chip bitmap to avoid random 
	visiting status access over DDR. On top of the graph reordering and 
	on-chip bitmap, we further build conflict-free parallel data paths 
	to make best use of the on-chip memory bandwidth. In addition, we 
	shift the random BFS level update from the main BFS processing and 
	hide it with overlapped execution of different BFS processing. 
	According to the experiments on a set of representative graphs, 
	OBFS achieves up to 12X performance speedup compared to the reference design 
	in Spector benchmark on Intel Harp-v2. When compared to prior handcrafted design on 
	similar FPGA cards, it achieves comparable performance or even better on some R-MAT graphs.
