\begin{abstract}
    Breadth first search (BFS) is notoriously difficult to accelerate on FPGAs 
	due to the irregular memory access and low computation-to-memory ratio. 
	Prior work typically accelerate the BFS algorithm through handcrafted 
	circuit design with hardware description language (HDL). Despite
    the relatively good performance, the HDL based design leads to extremely 
	low design productivity, and incurs high portability and maintenance cost. 
	While the increasingly popular HLS tools make it convenient to create a functional 
	correct BFS accelerator on FPGAs, the performance of a basic pipelined design remains 
	much lower than that of the HDL based design reported in prior work. 

	To obtain both the near hand-crafted design performance and the software-like features, 
	we explored the BFS design using Intel OpenCL and proposed a series of methods to regularize the 
	BFS processing such that BFS can be efficiently implemented on the FPGAs using HLS tools. 
	We start with graph pre-processing and reorder the edges into batches to ensure that the 
	edges in each batch can be processed in parallel. With the reordering, we further have 
	BFS visiting status divided into multiple on-chip memory blocks and each block can be 
	accessed in parallel without conflict. Meanwhile, we also have the coupled CPU 
	to gather the scattered frontier vertices as well as the relevant information 
	and provides sequential data to FPGAs. These methods enable regular BFS processing 
	and efficient hardware design with HLS. According to the experiments 
	on a set of representative graphs, the proposed HLS based BFS accelerator achieves up to 70X
	performance speedup compared to the implementation in Spector benchmark on both DE-5 and 
	Xeon-FPGA. When compared to the state-of-art handcrafted design on similar FPGA cards, 
	the proposed BFS accelerator achieves over 80\% of the performance on average.
