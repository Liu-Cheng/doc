\headerbox{Introduction}{name=motivation,column=0,row=0}{
Compiling high level compute kernels 
to FPGAs via an abstract overlay architecture 
is an effective way to 
improve designers' productivity. 
However, achieving the desired performance and 
overhead constraints requires exploration in a 
complex design space involving multiple 
architectural parameters and counteracts 
the benefit of utilizing an overlay 
as a productivity enhancer.

To address the above problem, a soft CGRA (SCGRA) with 
regular tiling structure is used an FPGA overlay. Because of the regularity  
of the SCGRA overlay, design metrics such as power consumption, implementation 
frequency are highly predictable and the system customization problem can be 
reduced to a simpler sub design space exploration (DSE) centering SCGRA 
scheduling and a straightforward customization with all the potential 
configurations well estimated using analytical models. 
With the proposed customization framework, we can achieve both high 
design productivity and performance.

The customization is a critical part of QuickDough.
By taking advantage of the regularity of the SCGRA overlay, 
the complex nested loop acceleration problem is greatly 
simplified and divided into two simpler steps as shown in 
Figure \ref{fig:customization-framework}.

\headerbox{Conclusion}{name=conclusion, column=1, above=bottom}{
In this work, we have presented an automatic nested loop acceleration 
framework based on a homogeneous SCGRA overlay built on top of 
off-the-shelf FPGA devices. Given high level user constraints and design goals, 
the framework performs an intensive system customization specifically 
to a nested loop. According to the experiments, it can produces quite 
similar energy-performance Pareto-optimal curve to that obtained from 
an exhaustive search. The customized implementations exhibit competitive 
performance to the optimized HLS implementations.
